# Roadmap

## Near-Term
- **Filler word module**: implement configurable filler word removal in transcription pipeline.
- **Import/Export settings**: tighten the settings backup/restore flow and ensure it reflects current shortcut set.
- **Recording pause**: add pause/resume with safe on-disk segment handling to prevent data loss.
- **Playback streaming**: stream audio during playback to avoid memory spikes (defer any heavy UI changes).

## Mid-Term
- **Settings simplification**: review and reduce visual complexity; ensure scroll content does not sit under chrome.
- **Scratchpad improvements**: explore a lightweight, fast-access scratchpad experience.
- **History UX**: further polish history browsing and search for large datasets.

## Long-Term / Ideas
- **Filler profiles**: shareable filler-word profiles and templates.
- **Text formatting upgrades**: improved punctuation and normalization rules.
- **Performance profiling**: formalize a repeatable performance test run for each release.

## Notes
- This roadmap is additive and reflects items discussed in the current session.
- Items will be reprioritized after the v1.3 release is published.
